This is the original, unedited, full-length version which predates \"Metropolis\" by three years.\n\nFROM IMDB: This is called the first Soviet science fiction film because of its \"futuristic\" sets on Mars, although most of it takes place in Moscow. The movie is set at the beginning of the NEP (New Economic Policy) in December, 1921. A mysterious radio message is beamed around the world, and among the engineers who receive it are Los, the hero, and his colleague Spiridonov. Los is an individualist dreamer. Aelita is the daughter of Tuskub, the ruler of a totalitarian state on Mars in which the working classe are put into cold storage when they are not needed. With a telescope, Aelita is able to watch Los. As if by telepathy, Los obsesses about being watched by her. After some hugger-mugger involving the murder of his wife and a pursuing detective, Los takes the identity of Spiridonov and builds a spaceship. With the revolutionary Gusev, he travels to Mars, but the Earthlings and Aelita are thrown into prison by the dictator. Gusev and Los begin a proletarian uprising, and Aelita offers to lead the revolution, but she then establishes her own totalitarian regime. Los is shocked by this development and attempts to stop Aelita, and then reality and fantasy become confused, and Los discovers what has really happened. \n\nDirected by Yakov Protazanov\nReleased in 1924\ncomplete print, runtime 111.5 minutes\na.k.a. \"Revolt of the Robots\" and \"Aelita\" (original title)",

A strong contender for the worst movie of all time.\n\nWritten and directed by Phil Tucker.\nReleased in 1955.\na.k.a. \"Hollywood Jungle\"\nTape-transferred complete print.\n\nNOTE: This flick would make a mind-boggling double feature with another Phil Tucker anti-classic, \"Dance Hall Racket,\" which is available here at IA.",

The featured players are Louis Wolheim, Jean Arthur and Robert Armstrong.\n\nDirected by George B Seitz.\nUS release 1930.\nUK release 1931.\nComplete print.\n\nTRIVIA: \"Danger Lights\" was the first widescreen feature film. However the 65mm widescreen prints, which no longer exist,  were exhibited in only two theaters, one in New York City and one in Chicago. All other theaters exhibited the standard 35mm print. The Depression and then World War 2 halted widescreen development for the time being.\n\nCAST NOTE: Louis Wolheim is best known today for his role in the oscar-winning anti-war classic, \"All Quiet on the Western Front.\" Its trailer is here at IA.",

Enjoy. (Don't be surprised if you are reminded of the current presidential campaign.)\n\nOur night of thrilling terror begins with the trailer for \"Panic in Year Zero,\" which tells us all we need to survive the coming nuclear holocaust is a camper-trailer and a few guns, but then the raping begins. The first feature presentation is \"Invasion USA,\" in which Commies from within and the Russians from without totally crush the US in a matter of days, and then the raping begins. The intermission short is \"Red Nightmare,\" in which the failure to attend PTA meetings leads to a Commie takeover. (sorry no raping) It's followed by that jaw-dropping bit of exploitation schlock produced in Hazlet, New Jersey, \"Rocket Attack USA.\" Sputnik and an absurd espionage mission bring on the nuking of New York City. At the end you may be forgiven for thinking someone should have nuked Hazlet, New Jersey.\n\n(Special thanks to content-contributing member Freddie Jaye for making \"Rocket Attack USA\" available.)",

Little attempt is made to expose the real horrors of Nazism or Goebbels' hate-driven personality. Instead it's more likely to induce giggles thanks to Wolfgang Zilzer's ham-fisted performance in the title role, which portrays Goebbles as little worse than a liar and vindictive rejected lover who abuses power. A romantic subplot only indirectly related to Goebbles takes up almost 1/3 of the film. (That was '40s Hollywood for ya.)  The listed supporting cast members are professionals but they can't help much.\n\nThis film only weakly qualifies as WW2 propaganda. In reality it is plain and simple exploitation.\n\nDirected by Alfred Zeisler.\nReleased in 1944.\nComplete print.\na.k.a. \"The Mad Lover\" (re-release).\n\nNOTE: The 1940 MGM film \"The Mortal Storm\" is a realistic and powerful indictment of life in Germany under the Nazis. Its trailer is here at IA. The film itself isn't. However it's widely available for sale or rental.",

Why is explained in\u00a0 my review which has been lifted from a place whose name is no longer mentioned in polite society:\n\"This isn't the Greatest Generation's World War II. It is an absurd, low-budget attempt at making a spy drama that instead became an unintentional parody. It features a commissar with a Brooklyn-Russian accent; elderly waiters tottering around with secret notes; downed allied flyers having a hilariously good time in German-occupied France; the most unlikely bunch of Nazis outside of \"The Producers\"(1968); and that's just for starters. The plot is juvenile nonsense about a female Russian spy (Lola Lane) smuggled into Paris to save Anglo-American convoys. Her foil is John Vosper, who's laughably awful as a ruthless Nazi colonel who appears more like Hogan's Heroes' Colonel Klink. Lola lane's performance isn't much better. In fact, the only convincing cast members are those without lines. Capped with a jaw-dropping final scene, some might call \"Miss V from Moscow\" so bad it's good. I won't go that far, but I do give it three stars because this bizarre klinker must be seen to be believed.\" \nDirected by Albert Herman\nReleased in 1942\na.k.a. \"Intrigue in Paris\"\nComplete print",

(see note) Filmed before in 1920 and in 1936 as \"Les Mutines de l'Elesneur.\"\n\nDirected by Roy Lockwood.\nUK release 1937.\nUS release 1939.\n9 minutes are missing.\na.k.a. \"The Mutiny on the Elsinore\".\n\nTRIVIA: First telecast on 10/26/39 on NYC's experimental station W2XBS.\n\nNOTE: It is little remembered today that the World War 2 shipping shortage became so severe a few windjammers were placed in service as bulk carriers on less critical routes.\n\nFREE AUDIO BOOK: Jack London's complete novel is available for streaming and downloading at IA's Librivox Collection here:\nhttps://archive.org/details/mutiny_elsinore_1107_librivox",

This leads to romance for her, him and the canary. The great Constance Collier is part of the fun.\nNext Diana Lynn and Guy Madison costarr in the quirky romance \"Texas, Brooklyn & Heaven.\" However it's the noted character actors of its large supporting cast who provide much if not most of the off-beat fun.

No actors were used. Only RAF personnel appear (see cast note). Unfortunately the success shown did not reflect reality. Due to navigational errors and other factors, in 1941 the RAF\u2019s night raids rarely hit anywhere near their targets. This would change for the better as the air war progressed. IMDB rating 6.6.Directed by Harry Watt.Released in 1941 (UK and US).Complete print.CAST NOTE: Sadly many of the air crew seen in this film did not survive the war.SPECIAL NOTE: In late 1943 the USAAF produced a similar although much more detailed film on daylight precision bombing.

Like the films \"Mission to Moscow\" and \"Song of Russia\" its purpose was to boost support for our Soviet ally. It opens as a lighthearted semi-musical, but then abruptly erupts in violence and stark tragedy as the Nazis attack and occupy a peaceful Ukrainian village. Corny at times, over the top at times, yet there is no denying this film's power.\n\nDirected by Lewis Milestone.\nReleased in 1943 (see Special Note).\nComplete print.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE: \"The North Star\" is in the public domain. However in 1957 a drastically edited version with anti-soviet narration and added post war news footage was released under the title \"Armored Attack.\" This version is not in the public domain.

These three-hour extravaganzas for the cap pistol set consisted of a jumble of multiple cartoons (that often were racially insensitive), serial chapters and one or more feature films that always were B-westerns. Parents and girls (eeu!) weren\u2019t banned, but I don\u2019t remember either showing up. Saturday morning were the unchallenged domain of us vacant-lot cowboys.This morning\u2019s program begins with matinee serials coming attractions followed by two cartoons and chapter 4 of \u201cFlash Gordon,\u201d and then two more cartoons. Next it\u2019s chapter 5 of the first \u201cSuperman\u201d serial. Which leaves us with just enough time for two more cartoons and the Tim McCoy B-western \u201cLightning Carson Rides Again.\u201dSo stock up on buttered popcorn and Good & Plenty.
